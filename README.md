### Phase-1: Analysis of Sales Store Transactions:

**Problem Statement:**

1. **Total Sales Analysis**: Identify stores with high total sales over a three-month period to understand which locations are driving revenue.

2. **Daily Sales Perspective**: Analyze daily sales data to determine which stores have the highest average daily sales, providing insights into consistent performance.

3. **Customer Segmentation by Product Categories**: Investigate how different stores cater to distinct clienteles based on the product categories they offer, such as cleaning products, pantry items, and snacks.

4. **Sales Composition by Category**: Examine the dominance of product categories across stores in terms of units sold to understand each store's sales composition.

5. **Relationship Between Sales Volume and Product Categories**: Explore the relationship between sales volume and product categories to identify store strategies and potential areas for improvement.

6. **Store Performance and Business Strategies**: Investigate the impact of physical store size and sales composition by unit on store performance to inform potential business strategies.

**Conclusions:**

1. **Total Sales Analysis**: Stores 7, 9, 5, 2, and 4 are highlighted for their notable total sales over a three-month period, indicating their importance in driving revenue.

2. **Daily Sales Perspective**: Contrary to total sales, the analysis of daily sales reveals a different perspective. Stores 9, 8, 4, 6, and 2 show the highest average daily sales, suggesting consistent performance on a daily basis.

3. **Customer Segmentation by Product Categories**: Different stores attract distinct clienteles based on the product categories they offer, indicating the need for tailored marketing strategies.

4. **Sales Composition by Category**: Analyzing sales by the number of units sold per category reveals varying dominance across stores, influencing overall sales composition.

5. **Relationship Between Sales Volume and Product Categories**: Exploring the relationship between sales volume and product categories helps identify store strategies and areas for improvement.

6. **Store Performance and Business Strategies**: Considering factors such as physical store size and sales composition by unit offers valuable insights into store performance and potential business strategies.

### Phase-2: Project on Temperature Variations Over Consecutive Days at Specified Intervals

**Problem Statement:**

1. **Data Integration**: Combine multiple data files containing temperature data at different intervals (daily, hourly, monthly, etc.) into a single DataFrame to enable comprehensive analysis.

2. **Time Series Visualization**: Visualize temperature variations over time, focusing on daily average wet bulb temperature and daily average dry bulb temperature to understand long-term trends.
  
3. **Distribution Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of daily average wind speed to understand the variability and typical range of wind speeds over the observed period.

4. **Wind Direction Identification**: Identify the prevailing wind direction by visualizing the value counts of daily peak wind direction, providing insights into wind patterns.

5. **Exploring Time Patterns and Relationships**: Explore time patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed, wind direction) using merges, aggregations, and visualizations to uncover insights into climatic trends and phenomena.

**Conclusions:**

1. **Data Integration**: Multiple data files are successfully combined into a single DataFrame, facilitating comprehensive analysis of temperature variations.

2. **Time Series Visualization**: Visualizations of daily average wet bulb temperature and daily average dry bulb temperature reveal long-term temperature trends.

15. ### Phase-1: Analysis of Sales Store Transactions:
1. Stores 7, 9, 5, 2, and 4 stand out for their high total sales over a three-month period.
2. Analyzing daily sales reveals a different perspective: Stores 9, 8, 4, 6, and 2 have the highest average daily sales.
3. Different stores cater to distinct clienteles based on product categories like cleaning products, pantry items, and snacks.
4. Sales analysis by unit sold per category shows varying dominance across stores, influencing their overall sales composition.
5. Understanding the relationship between sales volume and product categories helps identify store strategies and potential areas for improvement.
6. Physical store size and sales composition by unit provide insights into store performance and potential business strategies.

### Phase-2: Project on Temperature Variations Over Consecutive Days at Specified Intervals

1. Multiple data files are loaded: daily_data.csv, hourly_data.csv, monthly_data.csv, three_hour_data.csv

2. Data is combined into a merged DataFrame with outer joins on 'DATE' column.

3. Timeseries data is visualized - daily average wet bulb temp over time and daily average dry bulb temp over time. 

4. Distribution of daily average wind speed is analyzed and visualized.

5. Prevailing wind direction is identified by visualizing value counts of daily peak wind direction. 

6. The analysis demonstrates exploring time patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables using merges, aggregations, visualizations and Pandas/Matplotlib with the multi-frequency climate data.
