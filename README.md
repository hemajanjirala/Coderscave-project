### Phase-1: Analysis of Sales Store Transactions:

**Problem Statement:**

1. **Total Sales Analysis**: Identify stores with high total sales over a three-month period to understand which locations are driving revenue.

2. **Daily Sales Perspective**: Analyze daily sales data to determine which stores have the highest average daily sales, providing insights into consistent performance.

3. **Customer Segmentation by Product Categories**: Investigate how different stores cater to distinct clienteles based on the product categories they offer, such as cleaning products, pantry items, and snacks.

4. **Sales Composition by Category**: Examine the dominance of product categories across stores in terms of units sold to understand each store's sales composition.

5. **Relationship Between Sales Volume and Product Categories**: Explore the relationship between sales volume and product categories to identify store strategies and potential areas for improvement.

6. **Store Performance and Business Strategies**: Investigate the impact of physical store size and sales composition by unit on store performance to inform potential business strategies.

**Conclusions:**

1. **Total Sales Analysis**: Stores 7, 9, 5, 2, and 4 are highlighted for their notable total sales over a three-month period, indicating their importance in driving revenue.

3. **Daily Sales Perspective**: Contrary to total sales, the analysis of daily sales reveals a different perspective. Stores 9, 8, 4, 6, and 2 show the highest average daily sales, suggesting consistent performance on a daily basis.

4. **Customer Segmentation by Product Categories**: Different stores attract distinct clienteles based on the product categories they offer, indicating the need for tailored marketing strategies.

5. **Sales Composition by Category**: Analyzing sales by the number of units sold per category reveals varying dominance across stores, influencing overall sales composition.

7. **Relationship Between Sales Volume and Product Categories**: Exploring the relationship between sales volume and product categories helps identify store strategies and areas for improvement.

8. **Store Performance and Business Strategies**: Considering factors such as physical store size and sales composition by unit offers valuable insights into store performance and potential business strategies.

### Phase-2: Project on Temperature Variations Over Consecutive Days at Specified Intervals

**Problem Statement:**

1. **Data Integration**: Combine multiple data files containing temperature data at different intervals (daily, hourly, monthly, etc.) into a single DataFrame to enable comprehensive analysis.

2. **Time Series Visualization**: Visualize temperature variations over time, focusing on daily average wet bulb temperature and daily average dry bulb temperature to understand long-term trends.
  
3. **Distribution Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of daily average wind speed to understand the variability and typical range of wind speeds over the observed period.

4. **Wind Direction Identification**: Identify the prevailing wind direction by visualizing the value counts of daily peak wind direction, providing insights into wind patterns.

5. **Exploring Time Patterns and Relationships**: Explore time patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed, wind direction) using merges, aggregations, and visualizations to uncover insights into climatic trends and phenomena.

**Conclusions:**

1. **Data Integration**: Multiple data files are successfully combined into a single DataFrame, facilitating comprehensive analysis of temperature variations.

2. **Time Series Visualization**: Visualizations of daily average wet bulb temperature and daily average dry bulb temperature reveal long-term temperature trends.
