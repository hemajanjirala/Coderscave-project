### Phase-1: Analysis of Sales Store Transactions:
1. Stores 7, 9, 5, 2, and 4 stand out for their high total sales over a three-month period.
2. Analyzing daily sales reveals a different perspective: Stores 9, 8, 4, 6, and 2 have the highest average daily sales.
3. Different stores cater to distinct clienteles based on product categories like cleaning products, pantry items, and snacks.
4. Sales analysis by unit sold per category shows varying dominance across stores, influencing their overall sales composition.
5. Understanding the relationship between sales volume and product categories helps identify store strategies and potential areas for improvement.
6. Physical store size and sales composition by unit provide insights into store performance and potential business strategies.

### Phase-2: Project on Temperature Variations Over Consecutive Days at Specified Intervals

1. Multiple data files are loaded: daily_data.csv, hourly_data.csv, monthly_data.csv, three_hour_data.csv

2. Data is combined into a merged DataFrame with outer joins on 'DATE' column.

3. Timeseries data is visualized - daily average wet bulb temp over time and daily average dry bulb temp over time. 

4. Distribution of daily average wind speed is analyzed and visualized.

5. Prevailing wind direction is identified by visualizing value counts of daily peak wind direction. 

6. The analysis demonstrates exploring time patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables using merges, aggregations, visualizations and Pandas/Matplotlib with the multi-frequency climate data.
